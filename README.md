## Heart of One Nation

<img src="https://onenation.xyz/assets/img/onenation_heart.png" alt="Heart of One Nation" width="55px" align="right">

Governments fail in their mission to take care of Humans and Earth.  
We no longer trust them.  
They loosed our respect.

So what can we do?

Complaints are boring...  
Protests? Too dangerous.  
Elections? Fruitless.  
Fighting can't be bothered.

**Whaf if we created a nation instead?**
    
## The Spirit of One Nation

<img src="https://onenation.xyz/assets/img/onenation_mind.png" alt="Spirit of One Nation" width="55px" align="right">

One Nation is a **planetary emancipation wave**. In peace, every one regain the power to choose for themself and refuse interference from non-legitimate authorities.

Where anger and fear give way to **creativity** and **courage**, there is no need for new leaders, nor for news laws and institutions.  

The Manifest warrants our **common quest for harmony**.  
This text is the link between all our differences.  
So that mutual trust makes us **act spontaneously in stigmergy**.
    
## The Body of One Nation

Firstly, One Nation vibrates in **each one of us**, and this every time a human being signs the Manifest in good faith with its heart and the soul.

Together, we form a **decentralised network** of Human Beings and Oasis embracing the values of the Manifest

Every oasis, fixed or movable, is free to experiment its own organisation.

One Nation connects **open-source projects** that **build up alternatives to usual instruments of power** such as : identity, money, education, food, medias, ...
